Revision history for Perl extension UNIVERSAL::AUTOLOAD_CAN.

0.01  Sat Apr  9  4:30 PDT 2005
        - Wrote module and released on CPAN.

0.02  Sat Apr  9 17:40 PDT 2005
        - Fixed a bug where errors were reported on the wrong line.
	- Added comment in code explaining a surprising argument order.

        - Added strict.  Originally this was left out because of how many
	  symbolic references there are, but adding it caught one accidental
	  global.  (Which could have led to an object having a longer life
	  than expected.)
	- Removed an internal debugging hook (installed/_installed) that I
	  used in development.
	- Thanks to a suggestion from Joshua Jore (diotalevi on perlmonks)
	  I noticed that Module::Build has "traditional" that I can use
	  instead of "passthrough", thereby removing the dependency that
	  users have Module::Build installed.
	- Cleaned up the AUTOLOAD stuff.  I find it bizarre that if I
	  assign a typeglob to your classes AUTOLOAD, $AUTOLOAD is set in
	  my class when that is called.  Convenient, but bizarre.
	- I only need to call the original UNIVERSAL::can on a call to can,
	  not to AUTOLOAD.  (If you reach AUTOLOAD, you know that it will
	  fail to find anything with the original UNIVERSAL::can.)
	- Removed use of no warnings.  Together with the "traditional" change
	  this should make my module work on Perl 5.005_04.
	- While I'm at it, use a backwards compatibility trick.  This module
  	  now has a chance of working all of the way back to 5.003.
	- I had not duplicated all of Perl's message on missing methods.
	  Improved compatibility and added tests.
	- Changed the order of testing for CAN and checking installed.  The
	  new order is likely to be slightly more efficient.  Not that
	  anything else about this module is efficient...
