By default when you write an AUTOLOAD, the functions that are available
from it are not visible to UNIVERSAL::can.  Worse yet, if you try to use
AUTOLOAD in a subclass, you hide the AUTOLOAD in a superclass (or in
classes farther down the tree in multiple inheritance) so AUTOLOAD and
inheritance do not play well together.  See
http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=342804 for a full explanation of the
problems.

This module attempts to solve that.  Import this module somewhere in the
class hierarchy that you wish to have your AUTOLOAD, and write a CAN
which takes arguments and returns a function that will do that.  This
module will then provide an AUTOLOAD and UNIVERSAL::can that cooperate
and work properly.
